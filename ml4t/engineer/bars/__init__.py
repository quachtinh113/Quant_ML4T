"""Information-driven bars for financial data sampling.

This module implements various bar types that sample data based on
information content rather than fixed time intervals:

**Standard Event-Driven Bars:**
- Tick bars: Sample every N ticks
- Volume bars: Sample when volume reaches threshold
- Dollar bars: Sample when dollar value traded reaches threshold

**Advanced Information-Driven Bars:**
- Imbalance bars: Sample based on order flow imbalance (tick, volume, dollar)
- Run bars: Sample based on consecutive buy/sell runs (tick, volume, dollar)

The vectorized implementations are used by default for improved performance.
Original implementations are available with the 'Original' suffix if needed.

Based on "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos López de Prado.
