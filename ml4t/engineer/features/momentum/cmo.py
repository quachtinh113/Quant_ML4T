CMO - Chande Momentum Oscillator.

The CMO is a technical momentum indicator developed by Tushar Chande.
It is created by calculating the difference between the sum of all recent
gains and the sum of all recent losses and then dividing the result by
the sum of all price movement over the period.

    CMO - Chande Momentum Oscillator.

    The CMO is a technical momentum indicator that calculates the difference
    between the sum of recent gains and the sum of recent losses, then divides
    by the sum of all price movements over the period. The result is multiplied
    by 100 to give a percentage value that oscillates between -100 and +100.

    Formula:
    CMO = 100 * (Sum of Gains - Sum of Losses) / (Sum of Gains + Sum of Losses)

    Parameters
    ----------
    close : array-like or column name
        Input close (typically close close)
    timeperiod : int, default 14
        Number of periods

    Returns
    -------
    array or Polars expression
        CMO close

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> close = np.array([44, 44.25, 44.5, 43.75, 44.75, 45.5, 45.25, 46, 47])
    >>> cmo_values = cmo(close, timeperiod=5)

    Notes
    -----
    - CMO close range from -100 to +100
    - Values above +50 indicate strong upward momentum
    - Values below -50 indicate strong downward momentum
    - Zero line crossovers can signal trend changes
    - Similar to RSI but uses (gain-loss)/(gain+loss) instead of gain/(gain+loss)
