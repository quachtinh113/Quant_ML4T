    """Compute Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) for model-agnostic feature ranking.

    Permutation Feature Importance measures the increase in model error when a
    feature's values are randomly shuffled. Features with high importance cause
    large performance drops when permuted, indicating they are critical for
    the model's predictions.

    This is a model-agnostic method that works with any fitted estimator,
    making it superior to model-specific importance measures (e.g., tree-based
    feature importances) which can be biased toward high-cardinality features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Any
        Fitted sklearn-compatible estimator (must have `predict` or `predict_proba`)
    X : Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]
        Feature matrix (n_samples, n_features)
    y : Union[pl.Series, pd.Series, np.ndarray]
        Target values (n_samples,)
    feature_names : list[str] | None, default None
        Feature names for labeling. If None, uses column names from DataFrame
        or generates numeric names for arrays
    scoring : str | Callable | None, default None
        Scoring function to evaluate model performance. If None, uses model's
        default score method. Common options:
        - Classification: 'accuracy', 'roc_auc', 'f1'
        - Regression: 'r2', 'neg_mean_squared_error', 'neg_mean_absolute_error'
    n_repeats : int, default 10
        Number of times to permute each feature (more repeats = more stable estimates)
    random_state : int | None, default 42
        Random seed for reproducibility
    n_jobs : int | None, default None
        Number of parallel jobs (-1 for all CPUs)

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, Any]
        Dictionary with permutation importance results:
        - importances_mean: Mean importance per feature
        - importances_std: Standard deviation of importance per feature
        - importances_raw: All permutation results (n_features, n_repeats)
        - feature_names: Feature labels
        - baseline_score: Model score before permutation
        - n_repeats: Number of permutation rounds
        - scoring: Scoring function used

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    >>>
    >>> # Train a simple model
    >>> X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, random_state=42)
    >>> model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, random_state=42)
    >>> model.fit(X, y)
    >>>
    >>> # Compute permutation importance
    >>> pfi = compute_permutation_importance(
    ...     model=model,
    ...     X=X,
    ...     y=y,

    ...     scoring='accuracy'
    ... )

    >>> print(pfi['baseline_score'])
    0.92
    >>> print(pfi['feature_names'])  # doctest: +SKIP
    ['feature_0', 'feature_3', ...]

    Notes
    -----
    **Interpretation**:
    - Importance = 0: Feature not useful
    - Importance > 0: Feature contributes to predictions
    - Importance < 0: Feature hurts performance (may indicate overfitting)
    - Higher importance = More critical feature

    **Advantages over MDI** (Mean Decrease in Impurity):
    - Model-agnostic: Works with any estimator
    - Unbiased: Not inflated by high-cardinality features
    - Realistic: Measures actual predictive power, not just tree splits

    **Computational Cost**:
    - Time complexity: O(n_features * n_repeats * prediction_time)
    - Can be slow for large datasets or complex models
    - Use n_jobs=-1 for parallel computation

    **Best Practices**:
    - Use hold-out validation set (not training data) for unbiased estimates
    - Increase n_repeats (20-30) for more stable results
    - Check for negative importances (may indicate model instability)
    - Compare with other importance methods (SHAP, MDI) for robustness

    MDI measures how much each feature contributes to decreasing the weighted

    Notes
    -----
    **MDI vs PFI** (Permutation Feature Importance):

    **MDI Advantages**:
    - Very fast: Computed during training (no additional overhead)
    - No additional data required
    - Deterministic: Same result every time

    **MDI Disadvantages**:
    - **Biased toward high-cardinality features**: Features with many unique values
      get inflated importance even if not truly predictive
    - **Only for tree-based models**: Not model-agnostic
    - **Train set importance**: May not reflect test set predictive power
    - **Correlated features**: Can split importance between correlated predictors

    **When to use MDI**:
    - Quick exploratory analysis
    - When computational budget is limited
    - When working with tree-based models exclusively

    **When to use PFI instead**:
    - Need unbiased importance estimates
    - Have high-cardinality categorical features
    - Want model-agnostic importance
    - Need to validate importance on test set

    **Comparison workflow**:
    >>> # Compare MDI and PFI
    >>> mdi = compute_mdi_importance(model, feature_names=features)
    >>> pfi = compute_permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test, feature_names=features)
    >>>
    >>> # Large discrepancies may indicate:
    >>> # - High-cardinality bias in MDI
    >>> # - Correlated features splitting importance
    >>> # - Overfitting (high MDI, low PFI)

    **Performance notes**:
    - LightGBM and XGBoost: Production-ready speed and accuracy (RECOMMENDED)
    - sklearn RandomForest/GradientBoosting: 10-100x slower, avoid for large datasets
    - sklearn HistGradientBoosting: Fast but doesn't expose feature_importances_ (use PFI instead)
