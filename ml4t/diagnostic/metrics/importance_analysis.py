    """Comprehensive ML feature importance analysis comparing multiple methods.

    Run multiple importance methods and generate a comparison report with
    consensus ranking and interpretation.

    Use this when you need to answer: "Which features does my model rely on,
    and do different importance methods agree?"

    The integrated analysis includes:
    - Individual method results (MDI, PFI, MDA, SHAP)
    - Consensus ranking (features important across methods)
    - Method agreement/disagreement analysis
    - Auto-generated insights and warnings

    **Why Compare Methods?**

    Different importance methods measure different aspects:
    - **MDI** (Mean Decrease Impurity): Fast, but biased toward high-cardinality features
    - **PFI** (Permutation): Unbiased, measures predictive importance
    - **MDA** (Mean Decrease Accuracy): Similar to PFI but removes features completely
    - **SHAP**: Theoretically sound, based on game theory

    Strong consensus across methods indicates robust feature importance.
    Disagreement suggests model-specific artifacts or feature interactions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Any
        Fitted model. Requirements vary by method:
        - MDI: Must have `feature_importances_` (tree-based models)
        - PFI, MDA: Must have `predict()` or `score()`
        - SHAP: Must be compatible with TreeExplainer
    X : Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]
        Feature matrix (n_samples, n_features)
    y : Union[pl.Series, pd.Series, np.ndarray]
        Target values (n_samples,)
    feature_names : list[str] | None, default None
        Feature names for labeling. If None, uses column names from DataFrame
        or generates numeric names
    methods : list[str] | None, default ["mdi", "pfi", "shap"]
        Which methods to run. Options: "mdi", "pfi", "mda", "shap"
    scoring : str | Callable | None, default None
        Scoring metric for PFI and MDA
    n_repeats : int, default 10
        Number of permutations for PFI
    random_state : int | None, default 42
        Random seed for reproducibility

    Returns
