    """Compute Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) by feature removal.

    MDA measures the drop in model performance when features are removed or
    neutralized. Unlike Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) which shuffles
    feature values, MDA replaces feature values with a constant (mean, median,
    or zero), simulating complete feature unavailability.

    This approach naturally supports feature groups (e.g., one-hot encoded
    categoricals, related features like lat/lon) by removing multiple features
    simultaneously and measuring the joint importance.

    **Supported Models**:
    - Any fitted sklearn-compatible estimator with `score()` or `predict()` method
    - Classification: LogisticRegression, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.
    - Regression: LinearRegression, Ridge, GradientBoosting, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Any
        Fitted sklearn-compatible estimator (must have `score()` or `predict()` method)
    X : Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]
        Feature matrix (n_samples, n_features)
    y : Union[pl.Series, pd.Series, np.ndarray]
        Target values (n_samples,)
    feature_names : list[str] | None, default None
        Feature names for labeling. If None, uses column names from DataFrame
        or generates numeric names for arrays
    feature_groups : dict[str, list[str]] | None, default None
        Dictionary mapping group names to lists of feature names.
        When provided, computes importance for feature groups instead of
        individual features. Example: {"location": ["lat", "lon"],
        "time": ["hour", "day", "month"]}
    removal_method : str, default "mean"
        How to neutralize features:
        - "mean": Replace with feature mean (recommended for continuous features)
        - "median": Replace with feature median (robust to outliers)
        - "zero": Replace with zero (can distort if zero is out-of-distribution)
    scoring : str | Callable | None, default None
        Scoring function to evaluate model performance. If None, uses model's
        default score method. Common options:
        - Classification: 'accuracy', 'roc_auc', 'f1'
        - Regression: 'r2', 'neg_mean_squared_error', 'neg_mean_absolute_error'
    n_jobs : int | None, default None
        Number of parallel jobs for scoring (-1 for all CPUs).
        Note: Parallelization is limited compared to sklearn's implementation
        since we need to modify data for each feature.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, Any]
        Dictionary with MDA importance results:
        - importances: Performance drop per feature/group (sorted descending)
        - feature_names: Feature/group labels (sorted by importance)
        - baseline_score: Model score before feature removal
        - removal_method: Method used to neutralize features
        - scoring: Scoring function used
        - n_features: Number of features/groups evaluated

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If removal_method is not one of: "mean", "median", "zero"
    ValueError
        If feature_groups contains unknown feature names
    ValueError
        If X and y have different numbers of samples

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> # Train a simple model
    >>> X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_informative=3, random_state=42)
    >>> model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
    >>> model.fit(X, y)
    >>>
    >>> # Compute MDA importance
    >>> mda = compute_mda_importance(
    ...     model=model,
    ...     X=X,
    ...     y=y,
    ...     removal_method='mean',
    ...     scoring='accuracy'
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Examine results
    >>> print(f"Baseline score: {mda['baseline_score']:.3f}")
    >>> print(f"Most important feature: {next(iter(mda['feature_names']))}")
    >>> print(f"Importance (accuracy drop): {next(iter(mda['importances'])):.3f}")
    Baseline score: 0.920
    Most important feature: feature_3
    Importance (accuracy drop): 0.124

    **Feature Groups Example**:

    >>> # Group related features (e.g., one-hot encoded categorical)
    >>> feature_groups = {
    ...     "category_A": ["feature_0", "feature_1", "feature_2"],
    ...     "category_B": ["feature_3", "feature_4"],
    ...     "numeric": ["feature_5", "feature_6", "feature_7"]
    ... }
    >>>
    >>> mda_groups = compute_mda_importance(
    ...     model=model,
    ...     X=X,
    ...     y=y,
    ...     feature_groups=feature_groups,
    ...     removal_method='mean'
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # See which group is most important
    >>> print(f"Most important group: {next(iter(mda_groups['feature_names']))}")
    >>> print(f"Group importance: {next(iter(mda_groups['importances'])):.3f}")

    Notes
    -----
    **MDA vs PFI** (Permutation Feature Importance):

    **MDA Characteristics**:
    - Removes feature completely (sets to constant)
    - Simulates true feature unavailability
    - May show larger importance drops than PFI
    - Naturally supports feature groups
    - Similar computational cost to PFI

    **PFI Characteristics**:
    - Shuffles feature values (breaks feature-target relationship)
    - Preserves feature distribution
    - May show smaller importance drops
    - Requires additional logic for feature groups
    - More commonly used in literature

    **When to use MDA**:
    - Want to simulate complete feature removal
    - Need to evaluate feature groups jointly
    - Want more conservative importance estimates
    - Comparing "with feature" vs "without feature" scenarios

    **When to use PFI instead**:
    - Want to match published baselines (PFI more common)
    - Need to preserve feature distributions
    - Want less conservative importance estimates

    **Feature Groups**:
    Feature groups are useful for:
    - One-hot encoded categoricals (remove all dummy variables together)
    - Related features (lat/lon, year/month/day)
    - Multi-dimensional embeddings
    - Polynomial features of same base feature

    Removing feature groups jointly captures their combined importance,
    which can be higher than the sum of individual importances due to
    interactions between features in the group.

    **Removal Methods**:

    - **mean**: Most common choice for continuous features. Replaces feature
      with its training set mean. This is a "neutral" value that doesn't
      distort the model's input distribution.

    - **median**: More robust to outliers than mean. Useful for features with
      skewed distributions or outliers.

    - **zero**: Simple but can be problematic if zero is out-of-distribution
      for a feature (e.g., if feature is always positive). Use with caution.

    **Computational Cost**:
    - Time complexity: O(n_features * prediction_time) or O(n_groups * prediction_time)
    - Same order as PFI (one evaluation per feature/group)
    - Cannot be trivially parallelized (requires data modification)
    - Faster than SHAP for large datasets

    **Comparison with Other Methods**:

    | Method | Speed    | Groups | Local | Theory      | Bias |
    |--------|----------|--------|-------|-------------|------|
    | MDI    | Fastest  | No     | No    | Weak        | Yes  |
    | PFI    | Slow     | Hard   | No    | Strong      | No   |
    | MDA    | Slow     | Yes    | No    | Strong      | No   |
    | SHAP   | Medium   | No     | Yes   | Strongest   | No   |

    - **Speed**: MDI instant (from training), PFI/MDA slow (repeated scoring),
      SHAP medium (depends on data size)
    - **Groups**: MDA naturally supports, PFI requires workarounds, MDI/SHAP no
    - **Local**: SHAP provides per-sample importances, others are global only
    - **Theory**: SHAP has strongest game-theoretic foundation, PFI/MDA empirical
    - **Bias**: MDI biased toward high-cardinality features, others unbiased

    **Best Practices**:
    - Use validation/test set (not training data) for unbiased estimates
    - Compare MDA with PFI and SHAP for robustness
    - Use feature groups for one-hot encoded categoricals
    - Choose removal_method based on feature distributions
    - Verify model still makes reasonable predictions after removal
